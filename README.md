# Python Virtual Environment and Flask Setup

Here are the steps to create a virtual environment and install Flask:

## Create Virtual Environment

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv env
.\env\scripts\activate
```

This will create a virtual environment called `env` and activate it.

## Install Flask

```bash 
pip install flask
```

Install Flask package inside the activated virtual environment.

## Run Flask App

```bash
flask run --debug
```

This will start Flask development server in debug mode.

Now we have Flask installed in an isolated virtual environment.
